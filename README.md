# q.js
**q.js** is a tiny (as in 274B minified tiny), zero-dependency DOM selector library for IE9+ and modern browsers.
It is part of the [bla.js](https://github.com/guillaumerangheard/bla.js) library, and is basically an `element.querySelector` and `element.querySelectorAll` wrapper.

The API is very simple: just call `q(selector[,context]);` and *voilà*.
